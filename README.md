#  SVM Classifier on Breast Cancer Dataset

##  Task Overview
Use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for linear and non-linear classification on the Breast Cancer dataset.

##  What I Did
- Used `SVC` from Scikit-learn with Linear and RBF kernels.
- Preprocessed data (scaling, PCA).
- Tuned `C` and `gamma` using GridSearchCV.
- Visualized decision boundaries in 2D PCA space.
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

##  Results
| Model          | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------|
| Linear SVM     | 96.92%   |
| RBF SVM        | 97.58%   |
| Tuned RBF SVM  | 97.58%   |
